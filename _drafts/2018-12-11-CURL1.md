### cURL

Client for URLs (or cURL) is a software project comprised of two development efforts - cURL and libcurl.

+ libcurl is a free, client-side URL transfer library with support for a wide range of protocols.

+ cURL is a command-line tool for getting or sending files using URL syntax.  cURL uses libcurl

+ cURL is a tool to transfer data from or to a server, using one of the supported protocols.  

+ It supports protocols HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SCP, SFTP, TFTP, LDAP, DAP, DICT, TELNET, FILE, IMAP, POP3, SMTP and RTSP.   

+ Curl will be by default available in Linux and Mac systems.
